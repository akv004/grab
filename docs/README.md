# Documentation Index

Welcome to the spec-based development system. Specs are the source of truth and everything traces back to them.

## How to Navigate
- Start with [GETTING_STARTED](GETTING_STARTED.md) to understand the workflow and rules.
- Browse [specs](specs/INDEX.md) to see planned and active work.
- Pick tasks from [tasks](tasks/INDEX.md) that link back to specs.
- Review architectural context and decisions in [architecture](architecture/OVERVIEW.md) and [DECISIONS](architecture/DECISIONS.md).
- Use the guides in [guides](guides/) for authoring specs, implementing features, and reviewing PRs.
- Templates live under the respective `templates/` directories.

## Directory Index

- [guides/](guides/) — authoring, implementation, and review guides.
