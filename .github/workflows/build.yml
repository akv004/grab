name: Build Cross-Platform Binaries

# This workflow builds cross-platform binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows
# Artifacts are stored in GitHub Actions and can be downloaded from:
# 1. The Actions tab → Select the workflow run → Scroll to "Artifacts" section
# 2. Artifacts are retained for 7 days
# 3. For tagged releases (v*), binaries are also attached to the GitHub Release
