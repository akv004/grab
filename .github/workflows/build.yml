name: Build Cross-Platform Binaries

# This workflow builds cross-platform binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows
# 
# Distribution Strategy (Following Best Practices):
# 1. Development builds (main branch): 
#    - Primary: Published to "Latest Development Build" pre-release on GitHub Releases (public access, no authentication)
#    - Backup: Available as GitHub Actions artifacts (90-day retention, requires authentication)
# 2. Stable releases (version tags): Attached to versioned GitHub Releases (permanent, public access)
# 3. Binaries are NOT committed to git (maintains repository cleanliness)
# 
# This strategy ensures end users can download binaries without GitHub authentication
# while maintaining all best practices for binary distribution.
